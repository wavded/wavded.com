I gave a introduction talk to NodeJS at Twin Cities Code Camp earlier this year but never posted it. It had a great turnout with a great audience which made it fun as a speaker. If you are interested, below is the slidedeck for that talk:

We did go through some code samples as well which are up on [GitHub](http://github.com/applieddataconsultants/node-talk).

They took some interviews of the speakers as well about their talks and put them up on [YouTube](http://youtube.com/user/TwinCitiesCodeCamp). Here was my interview:
