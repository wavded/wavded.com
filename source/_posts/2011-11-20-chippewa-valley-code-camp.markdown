I gave a introduction talk to Node.js at [Chippewa Valley Code Camp](http://chippewavalleycodecamp.com/) last weekend. It was fun and had a great turnout. I found a neat idea from Esa-Matti Suuronen called [geekslides](https://github.com/epeli/geekslides) where he used socket.io in conjunction with Node to have a remote controlled slidedeck. I expanded on the idea and learned a bit from the process that I wanted to share.

I think my favorite part about presenting is that it motivates me to dive into the subject matter even deeper and wrestle with how to explain so it’s simple to understand. Prepping for a talk also gives me a chance to code around with technologies I haven’t played with much in my day to day work and to have an avenue to explore them and learn myself.

I hadn’t dived into any of the lightweight MVC client-side frameworks yet, namely [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) and [Spine](http://spinejs.com/). My MVC framework experience has been mostly with [ExtJS](http://sencha.com/) which is definitely not a lightweight. I ended up using Backbone for the presentation which was rather pleasant, simple, and produced some nice readable code.

[socket.io](http://socket.io) has been a hit for many coming into the Node community. Many Node Knockout competitors used socket.io in some form.

So the final product is on GitHub, called [node-slides](https://github.com/applieddataconsultants/node-slides) and you can [view it live here](http://slides.wavded.com/). Feel free to play around and run it, fork it and use it for your own presentations.
