**Updated: 10/13/12**: I still use Gnome Shell but switched to [Arch Linux](//archlinux.org) for a disto over Ubuntu.

Some [heat](http://www.technewsworld.com/story/73026.html) has [been](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/linus-torvalds-would-like-to-see-a-gnome-fork/9347] [rising](http://www.datamation.com/open-source/the-gnome-3-meltdown.html) around [Gnome 3/Shell](http://gnome3.org) spurned mostly by some comments Linus Torvalds had in opposition to the updated desktop environment.  This post really hasn't much to do with Linus however (I like Linus, I use his [operating system](http://kernel.org) and [version control system](http://git-scm.com/) daily)

I like Gnome 3/Shell a lot and, like [the Vim article I wrote](/blog/2011/08/07/my-text-editor-journey-so-far), it was an adjustment from what I was used to but I think its heading in the right direction (although not perfectly).  I'm not really here to convince you of a my stance though.  I just want to tell you what I like about it:

### The Desktop

![My Desktop](http://i.imgur.com/tZWzQ.jpg)

Above is my desktop (I bumped my resolution so things are easier to spot).  What I love is everything is out of the way.  It is very clean.  Time/Calendar is right there in the middle, extra widgets are on the right.  I love that notifications pop on the bottom, attention grabbing enough but stay out of your way (although this isn't perfect yet).  I actually like that there is nothing on the desktop, I didn't at first but I found that I can manage files much better using Nautilus w/ the extra features like split pane (BTW you can get icons back on the desktop with the [Gnome Tweak Tool](http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/introducing-gnome-tweak-tool-gui-to.html))

### Activities

![Activities](http://i.imgur.com/xbWZl.jpg)

This is one of the most genious features I think in Gnome Shell.  Hover your mouse over the Activities button or press `ALT-F1` (or `Super/Windows` key) and boom you get an overview of what's happening in your current workspace with the ability to launch new applications, organize your workspaces, close apps.  It's beautiful and [arguably better designed](http://www.se51.net/2011/08/14/24-hours-with-gnome-3/) than MacOS Lion's new [Mission Control](http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/mission-control.html).  I personally map my `CAPS LOCK` key as a `Super/Windows` Key to make it even easier to switch back and forth.

![Application View](http://i.imgur.com/5hY2O.jpg)

Another thing I have used for quite a long time is a launcher application so I can just type an app I want and hit `ENTER` and booya!  Gnome Shell has this built in and in a clever way.  Just start typing in the Activities view and results are filtered for you.  Just hit `ENTER` on the top match and it will either launch the window or switch to it if its already open.

Note that it doesn't open a new instance of an application if its already open.  This one was one of the issues Linus offered up in his comments, namely how to open more than one terminal this way.  For me, I mapped `Super-T` to open a new terminal and it works great.  However, I hope this behavior becomes more configurable in the future.

### Themes/Extensions

It's probably not a secret but like JavaScript and CSS and the rest of the open web technologies.  Gnome Shell is embracing this.  Its written using JavaScript and CSS. Themes for the shell are made with CSS.  Extensions are JavaScript/CSS (and perhaps other langs but not sure).  Gnome is embracing these platforms because they lower the barrier of entry (not saying JS/CSS people are dumb, but that there are a lot of us), plus they are good, solid technologies.

### Conclusions

I think Gnome is building some good foundations, it's not all the customization you get with Gnome 2 but seriously, its just a baby, it has to start somewhere and [more goodness is on the way](http://afaikblog.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/news-from-gnome-shell-land/).

### My Configuration

If you are interested in my setup.  I use the [Aldabra Theme](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=142247) and the Adwaita themes for both [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adwaita/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oojbknijfmdmidgcgchmojbildmbdamm) to get a consitent look with legacy apps and non-GTK apps.  Icon set is [Faenza Darker](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/08/faenza-icon-set-gets-a-ppa/) and I use latest [Zeitgeist](http://live.gnome.org/action/show/GnomeActivityJournal?action=show&redirect=GnomeZeitgeist) to get Recent Items in the Applications view.  Themes, icons, and more can be adjusted using the Gnome Tweak Tool.

### What about Ubuntu Unity?

I like [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) a lot, its my favorite distro by far for desktop and server environments.  I will most likely stick with them as they will support Gnome Shell and Unity.  I think Unity is half-baked at the moment and I don't really care for it but some people like it.
